# SCP-Mobile
Mobile (iOS) app for the SCP Wiki. Built with SwiftUI (and love) with Webscraping via a Python Webserver.
Made in 24 hours(ish) at [Virtual CodeDay](https://virtual.codeday.org)

## Running Locally
If and until this app is released on the App Store, the only way to run it is to clone the repository and open it with Xcode.
